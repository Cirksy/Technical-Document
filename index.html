      <header>Where to Find Pokemon</header>
      <article>
        <p>Finding Pokemon is actually quite easy. At the beginning of the game, the professor gives you one for free. However, if you want to find more, you'll need to go into the wild area (tall grass area).</p>
        <p>Different types of pokemon will be available in different wild areas of the game. So you won't be able to find all the different kinds of pokemon in 1 wild section of the game.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The game gives you a pokemon at the beginning because you are actually not allowed to enter the areas without one, it would be too dangerous!</li> 
        </ul>
        <code>Note: The different pokemon you can find in an area will have higher or lower chances to appear. For example, in route 2 there is a 50% chance a pidey will appear, a 40% a rattat will appear and a 10% chance a mankey will appear.</code>

      <article>
        <p>After walking through the grass you will eventually encounter a pokemon and the battle will start.</p>
        <p>In the battle you'll send out the first pokemon in your party and then you and the wild pokemon will begin taking turns attacking each other.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each pokemon only has 4 moves to choose from and they can be either attacking moves (does damage) or not attacking moves (status conditions and buffs/nerfs)</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Note: when encountering a pokmeon there is a chance for it to be shiny! (different color pallet)</code>

      <header>How to Catch a Pokemon</header>
      <p>It is a good idea that if you want to catch a pokemon, then you should damage it first. It is easier to catch a pokemon that has less HP than what it started with.</p>
      <p>Once you feel like the Pokemon's HP is low enough, go into your bag and select a pokeball to through at it.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The Pokemon does have a chance to break out of the pokeball, if that happens try throwing another pokeball. Once the pokeball, with the pokemon in it, wiggles 3 times, you'll have caught the pokemon!</li>
      </ul>
      <code>Note: Status condiditons (like poison or sleep) also make it easier to catch pokemon.</code>

      <header>How to Build a Team</header>
      <article>
        <p>When you catch enough pokemon to have 6 in your party, you'll have a full team! You'll then be able to use this team to battle other trainers and catch more pokemon.</p>
        <p>Building a team can be hard but to make it easy, just have a variety of different types of pokemon in your party for maximum coverage.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember that although having a bunch of damaging moves on all of your pokemon is nice, having other non-damaging moves on your pokemon can really be game changers!</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Note: Pokemon also have stats that help determine how they fight. They can be physically strong or defensive, or specially strong or defensive. Use this to your advantage!</code>

        <p>In the world of pokemon you can travel anywhere and see tons of different pokemon. If you go town to town, you'll see gym leaders which are really tough trainers to beat.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you beat all of the gym leaders as well as the top 4-5 trainers in the region, you'll be declared the champion!</li>
        </ul>
        <code>If you become the champion, there is a chance for you to visit other regions and see even more pokemon to catch!</code>
